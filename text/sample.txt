Tailgating another vehicle is unsafe and illegal. Many rear-end collisions are caused by drivers
following too close to the vehicle in front of them. The rules state that a driver must keep sufficient
distance from the vehicle in front in order to stop safely and avoid a collision. Drivers should allow a
minimum two secondsâ€™ gap between their vehicle and the one ahead. At sixty kilometres an hour, this
equates to thirty-three metres; at a hundred it equates to fifty-five metres. More distance is needed to
safely stop in rain or poor visibility
